## About This Project

This repository demonstrates my skills in building reliable, maintainable, and scalable automation test suites for web applications. It covers:

- Use of **Selenium WebDriver** for browser automation  
- Writing test cases with **Pytest** framework for powerful test execution and reporting  
- Integration of **explicit waits**, exception handling, and assertions for robust validation  
- Organized project structure following QA best practices
